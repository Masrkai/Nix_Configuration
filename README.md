This is a very specialized configuration i really put my heart into over a year to have redundancy for my system because this is the whole point of NixOS in the first place

 - I have been learning Nix for a Year until the last update of this configuration, I am no expert like some others maybe are so take my choices with a grain of salt

 - Reviewed README on "8/9/2024"
