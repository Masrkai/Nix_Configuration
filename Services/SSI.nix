# SSI - Secret Service Integration, using keePassXC because KDE_wallet implementation is horrible it costed me a rollback checkup 2 times (even tho i was ready i am not risking it)

#? Store a dummy secret (It will prompt you to type a password)
#> secret-tool store --label="test-secret" service "mytest" username "testuser"

#? Retrieve it back
#> secret-tool lookup service "mytest" username "testuser"

#? # List all secrets visible via secret service
#> secret-tool search --all service "mytest"

#? What to watch for:
#? Store: KeePassXC should pop up asking you to confirm saving the secret into its database (it'll ask which group)
#? Lookup: should return your password without any GUI appearing
#? If DB is locked: KeePassXC will prompt for your master password first, then serve the secret
