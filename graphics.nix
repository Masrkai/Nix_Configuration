  #? History lesson
  # There were two separate migration hops that happened for the cuda cache
  #
  # 1st The nixpkgs-cuda-ci project (which powered cuda-maintainers.cachix.org) was discontinued
  # in favour of the CUDA-enabled nixpkgs release built on the "community Hydra"
  # and cached at nix-community.cachix.org .
  #
  # 2nd The cache moved from cuda-maintainers.cachix.org to
  # cache.nixos-cuda.org in November 2025, So (nix-community.cachix.org) was a transitional step.
  #
  # Conclusion is, don't use (cuda-maintainers.cachix.org) as it's discontinued
